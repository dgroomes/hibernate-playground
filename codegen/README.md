# codegen

Use the *Hibernate Tools* library to codegen Java source code (entities) from an existing database schema.


## Description

The [Hibernate Tools](https://hibernate.org/tools/) project contains various tools that make your Hibernate development
more sophisticated. These tools are generally geared to support a suite of Eclipse IDE plugins, but they can be used
in a headless way. That's exactly what the `hibernate-playground/codegen` does. It uses the [`hibernate-tools-orm`](https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-tools/tree/d362340d5fad529ba25eba7123e2c007d0feb014/orm)
library to generate Hibernate entity classes (Java source code). Specifically, it does this by creating a simple
Gradle plugin and task named `hibernateCodeGen`. In fact, the Hibernate Tools project defines Ant tasks and a Maven
plugin for doing the same thing. I want to use Gradle, so I modeled my plugin after those but ignored all extensibility
features because this plugin is just for me.


## Instructions

Follow these instructions to run the demo:

1. Pre-requisites: Java 21, Docker
2. Start the Postgres database:
    * ```shell
      docker compose up --renew-anon-volumes --detach
      ```
    * This will start the database and initialize the schema and sample data.
3. Codegen the entity classes
   * This step is only needed if you have changed the database schema. For example, if you added a new column to an
     existing table, then you'll need to regenerate the Java entity class for that table so that it can map to that column.
     This project hooks into the *Hibernate Tools* codegen library by way of a Gradle plugin and task. Run the following
     command to generate the entity code.
   * ```shell
     ./gradlew hibernateCodeGen
     ```
4. Run the program:
   * ```shell
     ./gradlew run
     ```
   * Altogether, it should look like this:
   * ```text
     $ ./gradlew run

5. Stop the database:
    * ```shell
      docker compose down
      ```
